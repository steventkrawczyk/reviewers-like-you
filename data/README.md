This directory will be used to store data files. These files, which are mostly `json` and `csv` format, are not meant to be committed to git. This is because they can change from run to run, so it can lead to a lot of useless stuff getting committed. However, we need a file in this directory to get committed, so that the folder gets committed and we don't need to create it before our systems can start writing to it. So, this file is a placeholder to make sure the `data/` folder ends up in our git repo, even though all the relevant data files will not be committed.
